I am a Ph.D. candidate in Scientific Computing track at [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), University of Utah, working with [Cem Yuksel](http://cemyuksel.com/) since 2014 on various problems in computer graphics. My interest not only includes graphics but cloud computing, machine learning, web application and general software engineering. 

Before coming to the University of Utah, I received my BSc and MSc at Department of Mechanics and Mathematics, [Tula State University](http://tsu.tula.ru), Russia and worked as R&D staff at the [Institute for Computational Science and Technology](http://icst.org.vn/en/), Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.
