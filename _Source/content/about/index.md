Iâ€™m a System Software Engineer at NVIDIA, working for the [Rapids team](http://rapids.ai/) on CUDA-accelerated Apache Spark. Prior to joining NVIDIA, I was a PhD student in Scientific Computing track at [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), University of Utah, working with [Cem Yuksel](http://cemyuksel.com/) since 2014 on various problems in computer graphics. Far in the past before doing my PhD, I received my BSc and MSc at Department of Mechanics and Mathematics, [Tula State University](http://tsu.tula.ru), Russia and worked as R&D staff at the [Saigin Institute for Computational Science and Technology](http://icst.org.vn/en/), Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.
